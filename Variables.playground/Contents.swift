var favoriteCharacter = "Jon Snow"
print(favoriteCharacter)

favoriteCharacter = "Tyrion Lannister"
print(favoriteCharacter)

//favoriteCharacter = "76" would solve the error.

let ultimateFavoriteCharacter = "Arya Stark"
print(ultimateFavoriteCharacter)

//ultimateFavoriteCharacter = "Daenerys Targaryen" since it was declared as a constant, we cannot change the value, also Arya is my favorite character so I don't want to make it Daenerys even though she's really cool. I don't want to make ultimateFavoriteCharacter a 'var'.
